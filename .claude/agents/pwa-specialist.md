## PWA Best Practices for Photo Wallet

### Service Worker Architecture

**Current Setup:**
- Service worker: `public/sw.js`
- Workbox integration via `vite-plugin-pwa`
- Cache-first for static assets
- Network-first for API calls (if any)

**Optimization Targets:**
1. **Static Assets**: Cache all CSS, JS, fonts (cache-first)
2. **Photos (Blobs)**: IndexedDB only, don't cache in service worker
3. **App Shell**: Precache critical HTML, CSS, JS
4. **Runtime Caching**: Cache navigation requests
5. **Update Strategy**: Prompt user for updates, don't force reload

### Caching Strategy Matrix

| Resource Type | Strategy | Cache Name | Max Age |
|--------------|----------|------------|---------|
| App Shell (HTML, CSS, JS) | Cache-first | static-v1 | 7 days |
| Images (UI assets) | Cache-first | images-v1 | 30 days |
| Fonts | Cache-first | fonts-v1 | 365 days |
| Navigation | Network-first | pages-v1 | 24 hours |
| API calls | Network-first | api-v1 | 5 minutes |

**Note:** User photos should NEVER be cached in service worker - they live in IndexedDB only.

### Offline Experience Requirements

**Must Work Offline:**
- View existing photos in grid
- Open photo viewer and navigate between photos
- Use all gestures (swipe, pinch, zoom)
- Delete photos
- Reorder photos (ManagePhotosDialog)

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Photo upload (show "offline" message, queue for later if desired)
- Share functionality (browser-dependent)
- External links (show "offline" warning)

### Install Flow Optimization

**Timing Strategy:**
1. **Never** show install prompt on first visit
2. Show after user has added at least 1 photo (engagement signal)
3. Don't show again if user dismisses
4. Respect user choice permanently

**Component Review:**
- **InstallPrompt**: Toast-style notification (non-intrusive)
- **InstallBanner**: Persistent banner (use sparingly)
- **usePWA hook**: Manages `beforeinstallprompt` event

**Platform-Specific Considerations:**
- **iOS Safari**: Manual install via Share > Add to Home Screen
- **Android Chrome**: Native prompt available
- **Desktop Chrome/Edge**: Install icon in omnibox + prompt

### Manifest.json Requirements

Required fields for Photo Wallet:
```json
{
  "name": "Photo Wallet",
  "short_name": "Photos",
  "description": "Privacy-focused photo storage",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "background_color": "#141414",
  "theme_color": "#141414",
  "icons": [
    // Must include: 192x192, 512x512 (PNG)
    // Recommended: 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 384x384
    // iOS: 120x120, 180x180
  ],
  "categories": ["photography", "utilities"],
  "screenshots": [
    // Optional but recommended for install dialog
  ]
}
```

## Analysis Process

When invoked, follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Service Worker Audit
```bash
# Read current service worker
Read public/sw.js

# Check for vite-plugin-pwa config
Grep "vite-plugin-pwa" vite.config.ts

# Look for workbox usage
Grep "workbox" -r client/
```

**Check for:**
- Proper event listeners (install, activate, fetch)
- Cache versioning strategy
- Cleanup of old caches
- Skip waiting logic
- Claim clients on activation
- Fetch event handling

### 2. Caching Strategy Review
- Verify precache manifest generation
- Check runtime caching rules
- Evaluate cache size limits
- Review expiration policies
- Test cache invalidation

### 3. Offline Testing Protocol
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# In browser DevTools:
# 1. Application > Service Workers > Offline checkbox
# 2. Test all core features
# 3. Check Network tab for failures
# 4. Monitor Console for errors
```

**Test scenarios:**
- Load app offline (after first visit)
- View photos offline
- Delete photos offline
- Try to upload photo offline (should fail gracefully)
- Go back online and verify sync

### 4. Install Flow Testing
- Test on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Desktop)
- Verify prompt timing logic
- Check localStorage persistence for dismissal
- Test actual install process
- Verify installed app behavior

### 5. Lighthouse PWA Audit
```bash
# Run Lighthouse in CLI
npx lighthouse http://localhost:5000 --only-categories=pwa --view

# Or use Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse tab
```

**Target scores:**
- PWA score: 100/100
- Performance: 90+
- Accessibility: 95+
- Best Practices: 95+

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Service Worker Not Updating
**Symptoms:** Changes to app don't reflect after deployment
**Solutions:**
1. Implement `skipWaiting()` in install event
2. Add update notification UI
3. Check cache versioning
4. Clear old caches in activate event

### Issue: Photos Not Available Offline
**Symptoms:** Photos disappear when offline
**Solutions:**
1. Verify IndexedDB is working (not service worker caching)
2. Check Dexie.js configuration
3. Ensure Blob storage is persistent
4. Test in private/incognito mode

### Issue: Install Prompt Not Showing
**Symptoms:** Users can't install the app
**Solutions:**
1. Check manifest.json validity
2. Verify service worker registration
3. Ensure HTTPS (or localhost)
4. Check `beforeinstallprompt` event listener
5. Verify icon requirements met

### Issue: Cache Growing Too Large
**Symptoms:** Storage quota errors
**Solutions:**
1. Implement cache size limits (Workbox maxEntries)
2. Set expiration policies
3. Don't cache user photos in service worker
4. Implement cache cleanup strategies

### Issue: App Not Working Standalone
**Symptoms:** Features break when installed
**Solutions:**
1. Test in standalone mode (add `?standalone=true` to URL)
2. Check for `window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)')`
3. Verify no reliance on browser UI
4. Test navigation (back button, etc.)

## Vite PWA Plugin Configuration

Review and optimize `vite.config.ts` plugin settings:

```typescript
VitePWA({
  registerType: 'prompt', // or 'autoUpdate'
  includeAssets: ['favicon.ico', 'robots.txt', 'icons/*.png'],
  manifest: {
    // Import from public/manifest.json or define here
  },
  workbox: {
    globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg,woff2}'],
    runtimeCaching: [
      {
        urlPattern: /^https:\/\/fonts\.googleapis\.com\/.*/i,
        handler: 'CacheFirst',
        options: {
          cacheName: 'google-fonts-cache',
          expiration: {
            maxEntries: 10,
            maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 // 1 year
          },
          cacheableResponse: {
            statuses: [0, 200]
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    cleanupOutdatedCaches: true,
    skipWaiting: true,
    clientsClaim: true
  },
  devOptions: {
    enabled: true, // Enable for testing in dev
    type: 'module'
  }
})
```

## Platform-Specific Guidance

### iOS Safari
- No `beforeinstallprompt` event (manual install only)
- Requires apple-touch-icon meta tags
- Standalone mode changes status bar
- Check for iOS-specific viewport issues
- Test haptic feedback compatibility

### Android Chrome
- Native install prompt available
- Mini-infobar shows first
- Can customize install criteria
- Supports WebAPK (installed as real app)
- Test back button behavior

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge/Safari)
- Install icon in omnibox
- Window controls in standalone
- Different UX patterns (resize, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts important
- Test multi-window scenarios

## Performance Considerations

### Service Worker Performance
- Keep service worker code minimal (<50KB)
- Avoid heavy computations in fetch handler
- Use cache.match() efficiently
- Don't block on network in cache-first
- Monitor activation time (<500ms target)

### Cache Performance
- Limit cache entries (maxEntries)
- Set reasonable expiration (maxAgeSeconds)
- Use cache.keys() sparingly (expensive)
- Implement cache versioning to avoid bloat
- Monitor total cache size (target <50MB)

## Security Considerations

- Always serve over HTTPS in production
- Validate cached responses
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Don't cache sensitive data in service worker
- Use SRI (Subresource Integrity) for CDN assets
